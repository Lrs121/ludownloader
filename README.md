# LuDownloader 
## What am I trying to achieve?
I want to code some Rust, it's fun. This project specifically is a POC of a download client inspired by JDownloader. 

## Current state?
Working on downloading stuff concurrently from Rust, currently occupied with resuming/restarting the download, exploring messaging vs Arc<Mutex><Mutex> pattern. The download module will be added as a tauri plugin to the main application.
## GUI
I also have always slacked on properly learning some CSS and one of the 69420 JS frameworks out there, once I make some more progress on the downloader module I will start working on the Svelte & TailwindCSS frontend.
