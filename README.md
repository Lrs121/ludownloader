# LuDownloader 
## What am I trying to achieve?
I want to code some Rust, it's fun. I also need to learn some Frontend stuff, that's why I created the project. (Also because JDownloader has scaling issues with 4k HiDpi on linux.)

## Current state?
Working on downloading stuff concurrently from Rust, currently occupied with resuming/restarting the download. The download module will be added as a dependency to the download manager tauri plugin. 
## How to build/run?
```
yarn install
yarn tauri dev
```
